  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements comprehensively. REQ-1 through REQ-5 are all addressed with proper components, theming, and functionality. All 9+ portfolio images are referenced from the correct static asset path. The implementation also includes a few extra features beyond the spec (lightbox navigation arrows, category filter, stats bar, footer, mobile hamburger menu) which were not requested but are reasonable enhancements. No required features appear to be missing.",
