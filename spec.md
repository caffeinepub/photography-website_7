# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page professional photography website called "Lens & Light" with a dark editorial aesthetic, featuring a hero section, portfolio gallery, and about me section.

**Planned changes:**
- Fixed top navigation bar with brand name and smooth-scroll anchor links to Hero, Portfolio, and About Me sections
- Full-screen Hero section with background image, dark overlay, headline, tagline, and CTA button scrolling to Portfolio
- Portfolio section with a responsive grid of 9 photography images, each opening a full-screen lightbox modal (closable via button or Escape key)
- About Me section with photographer portrait, biography paragraph, specialty tags, and social/contact links
- Dark-mode editorial theme: charcoal/black backgrounds, warm gold and off-white accents, serif headings, sans-serif body text, spacious gallery-like layout

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a polished single-page photography portfolio site, view full-screen images in a lightbox, and learn about the photographer — all with a luxury dark editorial look and feel.
